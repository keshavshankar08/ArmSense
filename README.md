## Description
Over 500,000 Americans face limb loss or birth defects annually, with 5.6 million living with such disabilities in the U.S. Robotic prosthetics offer a potential solution, but their prohibitive cost of $20,000 to $100,000 limits accessibility, impacting quality of life.​ 

Our solution was to build a custom, portable sEMG sensing armband, which can wirelessly control a robotic prosthetic hand. The armband is worn on a user's forearm, harnessing the muscular activity from their residuals muscles. Our software application utilizes machine learning to classify the gesture a user is making, producing a control signal to move a robotic arm.
